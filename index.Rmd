This research group was created to the development of assignments of Biometry of Genetic Markers course (augusto-garcia.github.io/Biometria-de-Marcadores/), offered by Prof. Dr. Antonio Augusto Franco Garcia in the Genetics and Plant Breeding graduate program at University of São Paulo (Brazil). Here, we present the main topics concerning a QTL mapping activity.

Previously, Fishman et al., (2001) published a genetic map of the *Mimulus guttatus* species in heterospecific interactions. Using 174 markers, the authors obtained 14 linkage groups with a total map length of 1780 cM Kosambi. A new data set of the same population is now available with 418 markers. Therefore, our research group estimated a new linkage map for Mimulus guttatus based on the new data set. Procedure and results are shown in Material and Methods and Results, respectively. We also made a [video](https://youtu.be/ypYBHegRXTs), explaining how analysis were performed. 

Additionally, using this new genetic map and a phenotype trait, we performed QTL mapping using Interval Mapping (IM), Composite Interval Mapping (CIM) and Multiple Interval Mapping (MIM).
