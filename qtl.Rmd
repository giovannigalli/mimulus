*Interval Mapping*

The estimated threshold for both methods (EM and HK) were similar (Figure 1.A and Figure 1.B). This similarity conducted to an equal QTL detection, on what, 3 QTLs was found for the trait analyzed (Figure 1.C and Figure 1.D). Expectation Maximization and Halley-Knot presented similar results (Figure 1.E) Those QTLs were found in chromosome 6, 13 and 14 (Figure 1.F). The position and LOD of these are shown in Table 1.

*Composite Interval Mapping*

For CIM, EM and HK methods were similar as well (Figure 2.A and Figure 2.B), but in this case, only 2 QTL were detected (Figure 2.C and Figure 2.D). Expectation Maximization and Halley-Knot presented similar results (Figure 2.E). These 2 QTL were the same detected by IM in chromosome 6 and 13. The QTL on linkage group 14 wasn't detected here (Figure 2.F). The position and LOD of QTLs found by CIM are shown in Table 2.

Differences between IM and CIM using Expectation Maximization (Figure 3.A) and Halley-Knot (Figure 3.B) are presented. Comparing the IM and CIM we verified a more accurate estimation of the position of the QTLs detected (Figure 3.C (chromossome 6) and Figure 3.D (chromossome 13)). While in IM the LOD curve is wide, increasing the confidence interval of the position, in CIM the LOD curves are narrow.For each genotype, the phenotypic mean is plotted, with error bars at Â± 1 SE (Figure 4).

*Multiple Interval Mapping*

Genetic map with identified QTL are presented in Figure 5.A. Using MIM, we also detected 3 QTL, but one of them was different . QTLs in the linkage group 6 and 13 were identified, as in IM and CIM, and a new one was found in linkage group 8 (Figure 5.B). This new QTL had smaller effect compared to the other (Table 3). 
A great advantage in the use of MIM is the possibility to verify epistatic interactions between QLTs. Therefore, we can check that QTL in chromosome 6 and 13 interact (Figure 6), what may explain the detection of both in all QTL methods used. Comparing the LOD score curve of CIM and MIM, it is possible to confirm that they detected QTL 6 and 13 in the same position, once the peak of curves was in the same loci (Figure 5.D and Table 3). Peak on chromosome 8 for CIM was also identified, but not enough to cross the permutation threshhold.
